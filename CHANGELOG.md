### üîß Changed

- **Breaking**: Removed `MonitoringSteps` class (was not aligned with service-based architecture)
- **Breaking**: Removed `PerformanceMonitor` service (deemed unnecessary for v1.0.0)
- Moved `BaseStepDefinition` to dedicated file to resolve circular dependency

- Removed test files from TypeScript compilation in pre-commit hooks

### üêõ Fixed

- Fixed `parseInt()` calls to include radix parameter (Biome lint compliance)
- Fixed `forEach` callbacks to not return values (Biome lint compliance)
- Fixed circular dependency in step definition imports
- Fixed test assertions to match actual implementation behavior
- Fixed AWS SDK mock types in service tests
- Resolved all type safety issues - zero `any` types, zero non-null assertions

### üìö Documentation

- Enhanced README with better architecture documentation
- Removed outdated references to deleted components
- Improved code organization and maintainability

### üîí Security

- Maintained strict type safety throughout codebase
- All new code follows TypeScript best practices
- Zero TypeScript or linter errors

### üì¶ Internal

- All tests use properly typed Jest mocks
- Implemented safe helper functions for test step retrieval
- Enhanced mock patterns for better type inference
- Added comprehensive edge case and error handling tests
