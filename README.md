A comprehensive BDD (Behavior-Driven Development) framework for testing AWS serverless architectures and workflows. Built with TypeScript and Cucumber, this framework enables end-to-end testing of complex AWS service interactions including S3, SQS, Lambda, and Step Functions with real CloudWatch log verification.

// Development environment
const framework = AWSTestingFramework.createForDevelopment('eu-west-2');

// Production environment
const framework = AWSTestingFramework.createForProduction('us-west-2');

  retryAttempts: 3,
  enableLogging: true,
  logLevel: 'info'
});
```

# AWS Configuration
AWS_REGION=eu-west-2
AWS_PROFILE=my-profile

# Framework Configuration
AWS_TESTING_TIMEOUT=30000
AWS_TESTING_RETRY_ATTEMPTS=3
```

## üß™ Examples

### Basic Pipeline Testing

```gherkin
Feature: End-to-End Data Pipeline
  Scenario: Process uploaded file
    Given I have an S3 bucket named "test-bucket"
    And I have a Lambda function named "test-processor"
    And I have a Step Function named "test-pipeline"
    When I upload a file "test-data.json" with content "test-content" to the S3 bucket
    Then the S3 bucket should contain the file "test-data.json"
    And the Lambda function should be invoked
    And the Step Function should be executed
```

### Lambda Execution Counting

```gherkin
Feature: Lambda Execution Verification
  Scenario: Verify Lambda execution count
    Given I have an S3 bucket named "test-bucket"
    And I have a Lambda function named "test-processor"
    When I upload multiple files to the S3 bucket
    Then the Lambda function should be invoked 3 times within 5 minutes

  Scenario: Load testing Lambda function
    Given I have an S3 bucket named "test-bucket"
    And I have a Lambda function named "test-processor"
    When I upload many files to the S3 bucket
    Then the Lambda function should be invoked 10 times within 10 minutes
```

### Lambda Execution Tracking

```gherkin
Scenario: Verify Lambda execution and logs
  Given I have a Lambda function named "test-processor"
  When I invoke the Lambda function with payload "{"test":"data"}"
  Then the Lambda function should be invoked
  And the Lambda function logs should not contain errors
```

### Step Function Execution

```gherkin
Scenario: Verify Step Function execution
  Given I have a Step Function named "test-workflow"
  When I start the Step Function execution with input "{"test":"data"}"
  Then the Step Function execution should succeed
```

## üîç Key Differentiators

### Real Lambda Execution Verification

Unlike other frameworks that only check if Lambda functions exist, this framework verifies **actual execution** using CloudWatch logs. This unique capability ensures your Lambdas are truly being invoked by your event sources, not just deployed.

### Comprehensive Step Definitions

All step definitions are strongly typed and fully tested:
- **S3Steps**: 100% test coverage - File operations with retry logic
- **SQSSteps**: 100% test coverage - Message operations with verification
- **LambdaSteps**: 92.85% test coverage - Execution tracking and log analysis
- **StepFunctionSteps**: 100% test coverage - Workflow execution and status verification

### Production-Ready Services

Battle-tested service layer with comprehensive coverage:
- **S3Service**: 91.66% coverage - Bucket and file operations
- **SQSService**: 100% coverage - Queue and message management
- **LambdaService**: 89.13% coverage - Function invocation and CloudWatch integration
- **StepFunctionService**: 59.42% coverage - State machine operations
- **HealthValidator**: 97.91% coverage - AWS setup validation

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration Management

The framework supports configuration through environment-specific config files:

```javascript
// development-config.js
module.exports = {
  testing: {
    verbose: true,
    defaultTimeout: 60000
  }
};

// ci-config.js  
module.exports = {
  ci: {
    uploadToS3: {
      bucket: process.env.S3_REPORTS_BUCKET,
      prefix: `reports/${process.env.BRANCH_NAME}`
    },
    notifications: {
      slack: {
        webhookUrl: process.env.SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL,
        channel: '#test-results',
        onFailure: true
      }
    }
  }
};
```

### Supported Configuration Files

The framework automatically searches for configuration files:

- `aws-testing-framework.config.js`
- `aws-testing-framework.config.json` 
- `awstf.config.js` / `awstf.config.json`
- `.awstf.json`
- `package.json` (`awsTestingFramework` section)

### Auto-detected Environment Variables

- `AWS_REGION`, `NODE_ENV`, `BUILD_ID`, `BRANCH_NAME`
- `SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL`, `S3_REPORTS_BUCKET`
- `GITHUB_RUN_ID`, `GITHUB_REF_NAME`, `GITHUB_SHA`

See [`examples/config/`](examples/config/) for complete configuration examples and [`examples/config/README.md`](examples/config/README.md) for detailed documentation.

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

The framework uses a modular architecture with dedicated service classes:

### Core Framework
- **`AWSTestingFramework`**: Main framework class that orchestrates all services
- **`types.ts`**: TypeScript interfaces and type definitions

### Service Classes
- **`S3Service`**: S3 bucket and file operations
- **`SQSService`**: SQS queue and message operations
- **`LambdaService`**: Lambda function operations with CloudWatch log verification
- **`StepFunctionService`**: Step Function state machine operations
- **`StepContextManager`**: Test step context management
- **`HealthValidator`**: AWS service health validation

### Step Definitions
- **`S3Steps.ts`**: S3 operations (file uploads, bucket verification)
- **`SQSSteps.ts`**: SQS operations (message sending, queue verification)
- **`LambdaSteps.ts`**: Lambda operations (function invocation, execution tracking, execution counting)
- **`StepFunctionSteps.ts`**: Step Function operations (execution, state verification, SLA compliance)

## AWS Environment Setup for End-to-End Testing

To use this framework for production-ready, end-to-end testing, your AWS environment must be configured as follows:

1. **S3 Bucket Notification**: Your S3 bucket must be configured to send event notifications (e.g., ObjectCreated) to an SQS queue.
2. **SQS Trigger for Lambda**: The SQS queue must be configured to trigger your Lambda function.
3. **Lambda Permissions**: The Lambda function must have permission to start executions of your Step Function state machine.
4. **Step Function**: The Step Function should be configured to process the input as expected from the Lambda.
5. **CloudWatch Logs**: Lambda functions must have CloudWatch logging enabled for execution verification.

This framework does not simulate AWS events. It only observes and verifies the real event flow in your AWS environment. Ensure all resources and permissions are set up before running the tests.
